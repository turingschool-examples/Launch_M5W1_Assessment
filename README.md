# Week 1 Assessment

For this assessment, imagine that you are at an interview.  Answer each question as you would for an interviewer.  Similarly, treat the exercises as part of the interview - show the best of what you can do!

### Setup
* Fork and Clone this repository
* Run `update-database`

## Questions (7 points)

### Setup and Workflow (1 point)
* Check out a branch called `questions`
* Answer the two questions below
* Use a Pull Request to merge your branch into **your** main branch

1. How would you rate your comfort level and abilities when working with a SQL database? (3 points)
I would rate my comfort level a 6 or 7 out of 10. I can understand and perform the basics of a SQL database enough to work on one without help but cannot fully comprehend all of its features. For example, I can comfortably fill in queries in the query selector to find all specific data, I can create tables and insert data into them correctly. I also can add migrations and use the package manager console in Visual Studio effectively.


3. How do you familiarize yourself with a codebase you havenâ€™t worked in before? (3 points)
I use 2 good ways to familiarize myself with a codebase. First I look at all of the files to see which code I can understand and truly see how far the team was into their project, while doing that I am looking at the classes created so I can understand which direction this project is being taken into. Another way I do it is by running the program, if there's an output in the console I should have a good idea of the goal of the code, and/or if it's a web app check all routes based on the controllers to see which position I can jump in. Usually working in an unfamiliar codebase can be challenging. Still, I understand that it may take time to fully interpret the code, these 2 steps are always my main focus when jumping into an unfamiliar codebase.
## Exercise (11 points)

### Setup and Workflow (1 point)
* Check out a branch called `error-handling-logging`
* Review the existing code in the 'RecordCollection' project
	* run the project, and play around with all MVC and API endpoints

There are **many** places where this app could use some work in Error Handling **and** Logging.
* Identify at least 5 areas for improvement, and:
	* implement the improvement (1 point each)
* Use a Pull Request to merge your branch into **your** main branch
* In the PR comment, add a note for **each improvement** you made explaining why you decided to make the improvement. (1 point each)

It is up to you to decide what improvements to make, but you need to include at least 2 of each type (Error Handling and Logging).

## Rubric

This assessment has a total of 18 points.  A score of 12 or higher is a pass.

As a reminder, this assessment is for students and instructors to determine if there are any areas that need additional reinforcement!
